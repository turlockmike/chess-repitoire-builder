**Material gain off with**

From the opening, chess is about winning material and ultimately checkingmate. We gain material by focusing on attack targets.Attack targets are targets that you can attack with the aim of gaining material.

1. King \= pay attention to open paths towards the king\!  
2. Pieces  
   1. uncovered  
   2. insufficiently covered  
   3. higher value  
3. Squares \= on which we can threaten something, for example mate or material gain.

**Resume**  Focus each move first on preventing material gain/loss or checkmate, then gaining center influence and only then on development\!

**Capture opponents' center**

**Condition** to be able to attack is to capture the opponent's center. Taking your own center is an important step, but we still need to get the pawns one step further for attack.  
In the following diagram you can see two nice points.

By the move **e4-e5\!** White opens the diagonal for his battery (Qd3 head piece, Bc2 tail piece).  
And we threaten to eliminate the defender (Nf6 must go) and checkmate with Qxh7\!

The pawn in the opponent's center also gives direction to where we should attack.  
1\) e5 to the right  
2\) d5 to the left.

**When do we play the center pawn?**  
1\) When we are attacked by another pawn;  
2\) If we can drive a piece with tempo;  
3\) If we can prevent the opponent from capturing a useful center square.

**Resume**  
Keep in mind that the goal is always to gain center influence\!

**Function of a pawn in opponent's half?**  
The pawn structure should always be played first if it is safe to do so. After all, the pawns do a lot of useful work for us, viz a vie

1. Provides (safe) space for our pieces  
   1. Opens lanes for the rook  
   2. Provides support field for knights  
   3. Controls center Squares  
2. Ensures that opponent does not get his pawns in the center.  
3. Expels enemy pieces  
4. Gives direction where we should play (see e5 or d5 note\!)  
5. To keep the king safe, attack lines always run through the center.

**Resume**Pawns give direction to pieces, where they can stand (safely) and are a prerequisite for attacking.

**Destroy opponents' centers or gain pieces passively**

If white plays according to our conquering center rules (see previous block), the black center will quickly come under pressure. Black must have one**pay the 'price'** for maintaining his center pawn in the form of immobility of his pieces. Let's consider the following situation.

| Horse immobile | Runner immobile | Center unstable |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nb8 is locked up because c6 has to cover the center. | Bc8 is locked up because e6 has to cover the center. | Center is unstable, because not covered by pawn. Best move cxd5 demolish center\! |

**Resume**  
**Rule \= center pawn not covered by a pawn, always capture\!**  
**pay attention to two things, or conditions**  
1\) there must be no material loss.  
2\) no other pawns may have been captured yet.

**To develop**

Naturally, the most popular answer to the question of what the opening is all about is development. However, it is important to remember that the goal remains material gain or checkmate and to achieve this pawns must move into the opponent's center and to achieve that we must develop\!ðŸ˜Š   
Soto develop is essential to achieving our goals, but**always a means to the end\!**

Let's analyze the position in terms of development and what White has done.

|  |  | Pawns in own centerOpponents captured center |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  |  | Played minor pieces to the center |
|  |  | King brought to safetyHeavy pieces connected and central |
|  |   |  |
|  |  |  |

When developing, there are a number of important things that can help you choose the correct order of development moves. The aim is to create flexibility in your position, so that you can better respond to what is happening on the board.

**Resume**

1. **Pawn structure in centeralways determine first\!**  
   You do this until you have captured your opponent's center squares. Of course, only play if it is safe.  
2. **Play piece with fewest options first, is moreflexibility\!**   
   This way you keep the most options in the position. In general we can say that pawns have the fewest options, therefore first, then often knights and then bishops and the rest. Fully developing one side first can have advantages in terms of flexibility, because when the horse is developed, this largely determines the position of the runner next to it.  
3. **Chess is oneattacking ogame,** so playing forward and capturing the center is safer than defending**\!**  
   In chess, nothing provides more security and safety than having the center. All lines of attack to your king will always run through the center. Building and defending is therefore not safer than taking the center, even though it may feel safer at first.  
4. **Try developmentwithin 18 movesfinalize\!**  
   Naturally, we want to include all pieces and that is only possible if they have been developed. Develops means that they**active** in**functional**are.
