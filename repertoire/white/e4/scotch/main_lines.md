# Scotch Game Repertoire (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4)

## Opening Principles
The Scotch Game follows core opening principles:
1. **Center Control**: Immediate challenge to Black's center with 3.d4
2. **Development with Tempo**: Most pieces are developed with threats
3. **Pawn Structure**: Our e4+d4 center dictates kingside attacking plans
4. **Attack Direction**: With pawns on e4/d4, we focus on kingside attacks

## Initial Position after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4
![Initial Position](images/initial.png)

After 3.d4, we reach the defining position of the Scotch Game. This move exemplifies two key principles:
1. **Center Priority**: We challenge Black's center immediately rather than developing more pieces
2. **Tempo Gain**: After the exchange on d4, our knight recaptures with tempo on c6

### Development Order
Our ideal development sequence:
1. Control center with e4, d4
2. Develop knights to f3, d4 (fewest options first)
3. Place bishop on e3 (attacking Black's bishop)
4. Support center with c3 or develop to c3
5. Complete development with Bd3 and 0-0

## Main Line with 4...Bc5
After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Bc5, we have three major options:

### A) 5.Be3! (Main Line - 55.3% for White)
![Main Line Position](images/main_line_5Be3.png)

The sharpest and most principled continuation. This follows our development principles:
- Develops with tempo (attacking Bc5)
- Controls key central squares (e3 supports d4)
- Maintains flexibility for knight development

#### A1) 5...Qf6 (Most Common - 72.1%)

- Attack direction: With strong center, focus kingside

**Development Plan:**
1. Bd3 (develops toward kingside attack)
