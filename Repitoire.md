# Chess Opening Repertoire

## As White (1.e4)

### Starting Position
Initial position after 1.e4
Engine: +0.18 (depth 70)
Best line: 1...e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.O-O Nxe4 5.Re1 Nd6

Main responses (>20% frequency):
1. 1...c5 (Sicilian): 36.2% of games, 50.9% score for White
2. 1...e5 (Open Games): 25.6% of games, 51.8% score for White

### vs 1...c5 (Sicilian Defense)
As your coach, I recommend the Open Sicilian with 2.Nf3 followed by 3.d4. This is Arjun Erigaisi's preferred way of handling the Sicilian, as it leads to sharp positions where White can play for the initiative.

After 2.Nf3, Black's main responses (2200-2500 rated games):

1. 2...d6 (36.8%): Leads to Najdorf (after ...Nf6, ...a6) or Dragon (after ...g6) variations
   - Score: 51.5% for White
   - Most principled is 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, maintaining tension
   
2. 2...Nc6 (30.3%): The Classical/Taimanov approach
   - Score: 51.8% for White
   - Main line is 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, leading to rich tactical play
   
3. 2...e6 (22.3%): The Kan/Paulsen/Taimanov complex
   - Score: 50.1% for White
   - 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 is again the main line
   - Watch for ...a6 and ...Nc6 move orders

Less Common but Important Lines:
- 2...g6 (6.0%): Dragon setup
- 2...a6 (2.4%): O'Kelly variation
- 2...Nf6 (1.3%): Nimzowitsch variation

Key Strategic Themes:
1. White aims for central control with d2-d4
2. Knights are developed to active squares (Nc3, Nf3)
3. Development should be rapid and purposeful
4. Be ready for sharp tactical play
