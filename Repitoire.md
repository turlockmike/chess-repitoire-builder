# Chess Opening Repertoire

## As White (1.e4)

### Starting Position
Initial position after 1.e4
Engine: +0.18 (depth 70)
Best line: 1...e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.O-O Nxe4 5.Re1 Nd6

Main responses (>20% frequency):
1. 1...c5 (Sicilian): 36.2% of games, 50.9% score for White
2. 1...e5 (Open Games): 25.6% of games, 51.8% score for White

### vs 1...c5 (Sicilian Defense)
As your coach, I recommend the Open Sicilian with 2.Nf3 followed by 3.d4. This is Arjun Erigaisi's preferred way of handling the Sicilian, as it leads to sharp positions where White can play for the initiative.

Key variations we'll prepare:
1. 2.Nf3 d6 (Main Line)
   - Leads to Najdorf, Dragon, or Scheveningen structures
2. 2.Nf3 Nc6 (Open Sicilian)
   - Can transpose to Sveshnikov or Classical variations
3. 2.Nf3 e6 (Can transpose to Kan/Taimanov/Scheveningen)

[We'll analyze each line in detail once we fix our API tool]

### vs 1...e5 (Open Games)
